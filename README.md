**Pneumonia Detection using CNN**

Pneumonia is a serious lung infection caused by bacteria, viruses, or fungi. It ranks as the eighth leading cause of death in the U.S. and is a major cause of mortality in children under five worldwide. Early detection is critical, and chest X-rays are commonly used by radiologists to identify signs of infection and inform treatment decisions.

This project aims to assist in early diagnosis by developing a deep learning model capable of accurately detecting pneumonia from chest X-ray images. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is trained on labeled X-ray datasets to distinguish between healthy and infected lungs, providing fast, reliable results that can support clinical decision-making and improve patient outcomes.
